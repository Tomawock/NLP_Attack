              "~<br />This is a `3 for the price of 1' review because 3 people in my house actually had 3 different opinions.<br /><br />#1 tester did not think he liked them well enough to buy a whole box. He said that although it was tasty enough, the cookie's chocolate coating was hard and cracked into small pieces when he bit into it, the graham cracker-ish crust was too dry, and the cookie was too sweet to eat more than one at a time.<br /><br />#2 tester thought that they were very good (not great). He thought that they were a bit too sweet as well, but he (being a typical teenager) was able to polish off 3 or 4 with no difficulties.<br /><br />#3 tester was the most impressed. He thought that they were over the moon terrific. He loved the combination of the chocolate, the marshmallow fluff and the crust. With a tall glass of cold milk he was able to devour half a dozen of the sweet treats. (another teenager)<br /><br />I received an 8 oz box (18 cookies).  The packaging was fine; inside the box was a plastic tray with two rows of cookies. All of the cookies inside the box arrived in tact and looked beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",

I poured half of it in a small glass, and gave the other half to my teen-aged son (who loves coffee drinks). We both had the same good/bad opinion: The good part - It has a nice mix of coffee/cocoa taste, a little too sweet, but not bad. The bad part - You can definitely taste a tin-y flavor within the mix.<br /><br />All-in-all, not a bad drink, but not one the either of us would look for and purchase specifically, especially for the price.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

The powder easily mixes unlike most formulas.<br />I have bought other Earth's Best products and all are great.<br />At Earth's [...] they have gift baskets sampling of all there products.<br />The Amazon price of the formula for one can is the same online as in my store.

I was expecting it to taste pretty close to the movies, I even added <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004W8LT10\">Gold Medal Prod. 2045 Flavacol Seasoning Popcorn Salt</a>, it didn't. It was good but not any better than the Kernel Season's Movie Theatre Butter Popping and Topping Oil that I've been using since I got my<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NCPXBG\">Maxi-Matic EPM-450 Elite Tabletop Old-Fashioned 4-Ounce Kettle Popcorn Popper Machine</a> at the beginning of the week.<br /><br />~Conclusion... decent taste but not worth the calories. I would rather save those for some <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YLNUL4\">O'Dells Popcorn Supur-Kist Topping (Gallon) Non-Trans Fat</a> which I'm about to purchase, hopefully that's good!

I just might finally cut my foot off!\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         1\n",

              "\"І am a 28 year old female with ADD and mild form of narcolepsy. Before Concerta, І was tired and sleepy ALL the time and distracted. It&rsquo;s gotten to the point where іt was affecting my work. І thought enough was enough and went to my doctor. Concerta was the first medication he prescribed and it&rsquo;s the best. But we experimented with Adderral (good pill but knocked me out at 7:00pm after іt wore off, so іt didn&rsquo;t address narcolepsy) and Ritalin (heart rate was just insane) and Vyvanse (gave me anxiety that I never had). With Concerta І have 0 side effects, І am never sleepy anymore (but sleep well at night) and distraction levels have decreased significantly. Giving іt a 9 because І am not at 100% with focus. І wish it were slightly stronger.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 1\n",
              "\"​Hello everyone,\\r\\n\\r\\nI&#039;m your typical 18 year old lad and have never written on a forum before but I want to write something for the people that are worried about taking this (in my opinion) miracle drug. I am coming to the end of my 6 month course and I can honestly say it&#039;s been life changing. \\r\\n\\r\\nBefore I started Roaccutane, I was fairly depressed and seriously lacking confidence due to my appearance. But after months of failed treatments on various antibiotics, I was referred to a dermatologist who instantly said there&#039;s only one way to fix my acne problem, Roaccutane. At first I thought this is the worst case scenario and I&#039;m going to be even more depressed as a result of the possible mental health side affects. Depression has run in my family so I was very worried. However, living like with acne wasn&#039;t something I was prepared to do, so I started the course on 40mg a day.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first week I had a headache daily, but thankfully these die off after a week and paracetamol and ibuprofen will take all the pain away. Almost immediately, my lips were cracking and from then on in, I never went anywhere without some Carmex lip balm in my pocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the first 3 months went by, I was still breaking out and was starting to think it isn&#039;t going to work. However, I&#039;m so glad I stuck with it because now I haven&#039;t got a single spot of my face and the scars have faded to the point where you can barely see them! After the third month, my derm upped my dose and I started to take 60mg a day. \\r\\n\\r\\nLuckily for me I hadn&#039;t had any serious side affects. Just your occasional nose bleed and dry skin, and sometimes my eyes were a bit blurry but it&#039;s not much of an issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, I just want anyone reading this that is worried about starting this medication, that not everyone has a horror story about Roaccutane and I couldn&#039;t be happier at how it&#039;s made me feel!!\\r\\n\\r\\nDon&#039;t let acne take over your life!:)\"    1\n",
